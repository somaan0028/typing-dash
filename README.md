# Typing Dash

I'm pretty obsessed with increasing my typing speed. So I made a typing test webapp! Users can even log in to save and track their progress in the form of graphs!

## Technologies Used

1. Vanilla JS 
2. Node JS / Express JS 
3. MongoDB 
4. HTML, CSS

## How it's made

I was using different websites to check my typing speed and eventually decided to code my own, leading to the birth of "Typing Dash". The frontend is written in Vanilla Javascript while the backend uses Node JS, more specifically, the Express JS Framework. Passport JS has been used to provide the Oauth 2.0 functionality. As the user record gets saved after taking a test, it gets displayed in the form of a graph, for which the Chart.js library was used.
